# The Shop App - First Module
  - The third React-Native app I created with Expo following the course `React Native - The Practical Guide [2021 Edition]` on Udemy by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.
  - This module is meant for practice, so it will be similar to the `rn-recipes` app, but just a different theme and with more navigation and `Redux` managed state. It will set up future modules to learn handling user input, http requests, databases, and user authentication.
